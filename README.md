# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2024).

Find course notes and assignments [here](http://cs231n.github.io) and be sure to check out the video lectures for [Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) and [Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)!

These assignments were completed using Numpy and PyTorch.

### Assignment 1:

- [Q1](assignment1/knn.ipynb): k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. (_Completed_)
- [Q2](assignment1/svm.ipynb): Training a Support Vector Machine. (_Completed_)
- [Q3](assignment1/softmax.ipynb): Implement a Softmax classifier. (_Completed_)
- [Q4](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb): Two-Layer Neural Network. (_Completed_)
- [Q5](assignment1/features.ipynb): Higher Level Representations: Image Features. (_Completed_)

### Assignment 2:

- [Q1](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb): Multi-Layer Fully Connected Neural Network. (_Completed_)
- [Q2](assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb): Batch Normalization. (_Completed_)
- [Q3](assignment2/Dropout.ipynb): Dropout. (_Completed_)
- [Q4](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb): Convolutional Neural Networks. (_Completed_)
- [Q5](assignment2/PyTorch.ipynb): PyTorch on CIFAR-10. (_Completed_)

**Note:** In the open-ended challenge of Assignment 2, l implemented an amateur version of _ResNet18_ from scratch in PyTorch.

### Assignment 3:

- [Q1](assignment3/RNN_Captioning.ipynb): Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs. (_Completed_)

- [Q3](assignment3/Generative_Adversarial_Networks.ipynb): Generative Adversarial Networks. (_Completed_)
- [Q4](assignment3/Self_Supervised_Learning.ipynb): Self-Supervised Learning for Image Classification. (_Completed_)
- [Q5](assignment3/LSTM_Captioning.ipynb): Extra Credit: Image Captioning with LSTMs. (_Completed_)

### Important Note

All the code in this repository was written entirely by me. However, some of the answers to inline questions were inspired by solutions from a different repository on GitHub ([mantasu](https://github.com/mantasu/cs231n)). I reviewed these answers to ensure the accuracy and completeness of my own work.
